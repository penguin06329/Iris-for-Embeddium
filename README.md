![Iris: An open-source shaders mod compatible with OptiFine shaderpacks](docs/banner.png)

# Iris

**Embeddium 0.3.24 now offers compatibility with Iris 1.7.2.
Therefore, this repository is no longer needed.**
Fixed an error that occurred when using Iris Shaders in Embeddium when using Sodium.
However, the versions are 1.20.1 and 1.20.6 (since there is no Fabric version of Embeddium in 1.21).
